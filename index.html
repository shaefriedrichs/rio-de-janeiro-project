                    carnivals, samba, and incredible natural settings. In

                    the
                    Redeemer atop
                    Corcovado mountain, named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World; Sugarloaf Mountain with its
                    cable car; the

                    The city was also the host of the 2016 Summer Olympics and the 2016 Summer Paralympics, making
                    it
                    the first South

                <p>
                    Olá! My name is Shae and I'm an entry-level front-end developer from South Africa. I now live in
                    New Zealand and have for several
                    years, although I take any opportunity I can to travel. Rio de Janeiro is one of my favourite
                    cities to have visited, so consider this a tribute to <em>a cicdade maravilhosa!</em>
